SHOW DATABASES;
USE mydb;
SHOW TABLES;


Create a TABLE:

         CREATE TABLE users (
               id INT PRIMARY KEY,
               name VARCHAR(50),
               age INT,
               location VARCHAR(100),
               lastworkingdate Date
           );


To view Table data:

           SELECT * FROM users;


Delete a column in table:

           ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN age;


To view all table list:

           SHOW TABLES;


Add a new id and details:

           ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN lastworkingdate DATE;

Aadd new row in table:

          INSERT INTO users (id, name, age, location, lastworkingdate)
          VALUES (201300, 'B SURYA PRAKASH REDDY', 28, 'TCS-HYDERABAD', '2025-04-01');

Display table data with ID:

         SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 201300;

Delete ID in table:

 Mini project, is able to see user list in url level only, and you need to enable 3000,5000,80,22,3306 ports in Security groups, in docker-compose yaml i have mention all requiremtns to run our application. 

 create a new jenkins, add admin credentials and take my groovy ../jenkins.groovy. make sure in jenkins you have to install Docker, docker-compose, jdk, jenkins, mvn, python and all requiremnts. Make sure jdk 17 latest version we need to use in jenkins creation. Through old version we are getting error.

 clone project in your local or use my(our) repo, make sure cloning location should be same mention in build steps, once completed, please run your jenkins job, and verfiy all conatiners are created are not. 

 check with IP:3000 && IP:5000 && IP:5000/user/ID

 Make sure data you need to create in db container, what your mention in table data, we can able to GET in IP:5000/user/ID



if you have questions, please ping me üòä
